I've recreated the nostalgic Robots game using Python 3 and curses.

Copy and paste the source, grant execution permissions with chmod +x bigiots.py, and run it with ./bigiots.py.

Although this is the Robots game, I've renamed it to "bigiots".

The word bigiot is the word I created which means bigot plus idiot and big IoT.
